##**Description:**

##**Intended users:**
The intended users are the marker(s) of the project.

##**About the project:**
This idea behind this project was to create a very simple, but stylish portfolio that was responsive without using any media queries. It was an experiment that worked.
That was achieved by using all sizing of elements as percentages or "fit-content".

Also my objective was to create a site that does NOT use bootstrap as I wanted to get a feel for the much faster methods of using things like unicode characters etc.

##**Installation:**
There is no installation required as it is a web page and will run in most browsers.
